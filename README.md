# AR-Book
This project is focused on AR and few drawings are used to express the 3d animated object on the drawing the software used in this poject is UNITY and VIUSAL CODE 
In this project i get to learn how to have mulitple objects on a single data base and also adding materials with scripts 
but due to the bug in UNITY most of the scripts arnt working but objects are clearly visible and well excuted according to the project 
i faced few more challenges in unity when i try to duplicate the object but it was showing me error i belive it was again the bug
